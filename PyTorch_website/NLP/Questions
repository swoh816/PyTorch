For the semantic analysis using linear model (http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_nlp_tutorial.html), you optimize ONLY ONE weight matrix and bias.

--> Why not different weight matrix for different kinds of words in a sentence? For example, I imagine we can make different weight vectors for verbs, nouns, conjunctions, etc.
